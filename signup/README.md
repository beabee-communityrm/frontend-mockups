# Signup form

This is the signup form prototype using Nuxt.js for generating a static site. The plan is to use SSR for the frontend to properly interact with the Beabee backend.

## Getting things going

1. Run `npm install`
2. Serve a local version with `npm run dev`
3. Generate and serve a static version with `npm run build && npm run start`
